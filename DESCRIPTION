Description: Provides a range of utility functions for working with 
    plate-based data from microtitre plates such as enzyme assays, bacterial 
    growth assays and protein binding experiments. Working with column IDs, row 
    numbers and letters and transforming between a matrix and a data frame are 
    all made simpler.
